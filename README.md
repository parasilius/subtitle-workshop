# SubtitleWorkshop
This app helps you work with subtitles; modify them when they are out of sync with audio and rename
them such that the movie and the subtitle file have the same base name.
## set default path
The default path is `SubtitleWorkshop`'s parent directory.
To change the default path you can manually fill in the `new path` field and check `use defined path`.
To use the default path after submitting the defined path, you can just submit with `use defined path` unchecked.

Whichever path you choose(default or defined), this should be the path where your TV series directories or movies are.
Suppose there is an `<example path>`, and there is a directory, `<example path>/<myShow>/` in which the episodes of the show are available, or we have `<example path>/<myMovie>.mkv` and `<example path>/<myMovieSubtitle>.srt`.
So if we want to manipulate `<myMovie>` or `<myShow>`, we have to either clone the repository to `<example path>` and run the app from there, or fill the `new path` to be the `<example path>`(which is an absolute path) and check `use defined path` and submit.
## sync subtitle
Considering the example in the previous section, suppose we have all the subtitles of myShow's season $i$ episodes in `<example path>/<myShow>/<season-i-subtitles>`, and the goal is to move episode $j$'s subtitle and rename it to have the same base name as the episode itself.
So we fill in the fields as follows:

`Enter TV series`: `<myShow>`(note that this is the directory name, and may or may not be the same as the show name itself)

`Enter season number`: $i($i > 0)$

`Enter episode number`: $j(j >= 0)$

After submission, we should have these files in `<example path>/<myShow>`:

`myShow.S0i.E0j.mkv`

`myShow.S01.E0j.srt`
## modify subtitle
This section is for subtitle modification when it's out of sync with the audio.
Considering the above example again, suppose `<myMovie>.mkv` is out of sync with its subtitle, `<myMovieSubtitle>.srt`.

If we see a sentence but after 96000ms we hear the audio, we need to forward the subtitle.

To do that, we fill `TV series or movie name` with `<myMovie>`.
Note that every substring in `<myMovie>` seperated by spaces should be in a substring of `<myMovieSubtitle>.srt`.
Also there should be only one superstring such as `<myMovieSubtitle>.srt` containing these substrings.
If we want to modify the subtitle for an episode in a directory named `<myShow>`, we fill this field with `<myShow>` instead.

If we are modifying the subtitle for a movie(meaning outside a directory) we leave the `TV series` unchecked.
Otherwise we check the box and in the fields that appear we specify the season and episode number.

We can modify all the subtitles(all the `.srt` files) in `<example path>/<myShow>` by checking `modify all episodes`.
We can also modify all the subtitles for a specific season in `<example path>/<myShow>` by checking `modify all season episodes`.
Note however this will **not** modify `.srt` files in `<example path>/<myShow>` recursively.

We want to modify the subtitle 96000ms, so we can fill `Seconds to add` with each one of these:

$96,000$

$96$

$96.0$

$96.00$

$96.000$

...

In order to replace the original subtitle check `replace subtitle`.
Otherwise leave it unchecked and the modified subtitle will be saved in `SubtitleWorkshop`.

If we want to forward the subtitle(such as in this example), we leave `delay` unchecked.
